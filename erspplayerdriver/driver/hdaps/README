Driver for using the IBM HDAPS for controlling robots
=====================================================

The HDAPS driver provides a "joystick" interface. There currently
does not exist a JoystickProxy usable for client programs so the main
goal of this driver is to expose the "joystick" interface so that virtual drivers
can take robots may use it.

This driver is still experimental. Due to problems to get the Linux
HDAPS driver module to work it has not been tested. To test it use the
player/hdaps-scorpion.cfg configuration file together with the playerjoy
program, which maps "joystick" commands to "position2d" commands.
