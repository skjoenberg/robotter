ERSP driver
===========

The ERSP driver in this directory serve the purpose of making up for the
difference between running clients with Stage and on the real Scorpion
robots. The goal is to remove the need for conditional code in the
client programs targeted for both environments, thus making it easier
to use Player/Stage to write programs for the 

This driver is functional but still not complete or fully tested. To try
it simply run: make player, in the top-level directory.

Future Work
-----------
Some possible future additions include:

 - Provide a "joystick" interface. This can be used by the playerjoy
   program to map user input to a "position2d" interface.

 - Provide an "odometry:::position2d" interface. Odometry should be
   fixed so it reads from ERSP and updates the "position2d" driver data
   and sends it at the right intervals.

 - "Rate limiting" / improve queuing.  Example, an activated bumper may
   generate multiple inputs, which are queued and must all be read. This
   causes problems when using sleeping between robot commands.

 - Make it possible to enable/disable the ERSP avoidance system via a
   configuration variable.
