DIKU/ERSP/Scorpion specific "add-on" drivers for using Stage
============================================================

The drivers in this directory serve the purpose of making up for the
difference between running clients with Stage and on the real Scorpion
robots. The goal is to remove the need for conditional code in the
client programs targeted for both environments, thus making it easier
to use Player/Stage to write programs for the 

Sonar2IR
--------
This driver maps a "sonar" interface (as provided by Stage) to an "ir"
interface. For now Stage does not provide any "ir" interface, however,
stage uses the same internal model for simulating the "ir" and "sonar"
interface. Rather than changing Stage to support the "ir" interface
(which it hopefully will eventually), this driver works around this
issue by providing an "ir" interface based on the "sonar" interface from
stage. 

This driver is fully functional, although not all functionality has been
properly tested. To try it simply run the cave stage and use the "ir"
interface (via the IrProxy class).

Future Work
-----------
Some possible future additions include:

 - Mapping sonar to bumper:
   
	Stage does not yet provide a bumper interface. Since the
	Scorpion robot uses IR sensors for certain bumpers the same
	could be used for the providing a bumper interface. It might be
	mostly useful regarding the front bump sensor since the Stage
	world is only in 2D.
